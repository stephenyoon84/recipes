Ingredients

1 clove garlic, smashed
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 1/4 pounds Yellow Finn potatoes or other waxy-style potato
2 cups half-and-half
1 tablespoon kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Pinch nutmeg

Directions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Rub the garlic around the inside of
an 8 by 8 by 2-inch casserole dish and let it dry. Reserve the remaining garlic.
Rub the butter around the inside of the dish. Reserve the remaining butter.

Peel and thinly slice the potatoes on a mandoline or
vegetable slicer (about 1/8-inch-thick slices).

In a medium saucepan, combine the garlic, butter, potatoes, half-and-half, salt,
pepper to taste, and nutmeg. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to medium-high,
and cook, stirring, until the mixture has thickened, about 5 minutes.
Transfer the mixture to the prepared dish. Shake the pan so the potatoes are
distributed evenly.

Bake the potatoes, basting occasionally, until lightly browned and bubbly,
about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes before serving.
